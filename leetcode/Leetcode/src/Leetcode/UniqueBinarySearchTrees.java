Problem:    Unique Binary Search Trees
Difficulty: Easy
Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/
Notes:
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?
For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.
1         3     3      2      1
 \       /     /      / \      \
